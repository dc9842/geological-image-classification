BACKGROUND
A geology research company wants to create a tool for identifying interesting patterns in their imagery data. This tool

which are similar to it.

GOAL
Task is to create the machine learning component for this image similarity application. The machine learning
model should return the top K images that are most similar to this image based on a single image input.
